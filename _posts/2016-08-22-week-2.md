Been a pretty crazy week. Between settling in as a CS1101S tutor, finishing up work for the summer's CVWO (which, for some reason, is still going on long after the summer has come and gone), and just general trying-to-get-back-into-the-swing-of-things, I've had to squeeze in opportunities to learn React and work on the NUShare frontend.

Yeah, our app is called NUShare. And the logo has a rabbit! It's great.

Trying to get the hang of React and Redux is...interesting. Getting used to opinionated frameworks always is, I suppose. It took me a bit to wrap my head around the idea of actions and reducers, and I'm consistently amazed by how much of CS1101S is still applicable (immutable data objects? heheheh).

Our front-end is pretty woefully underdone for the mid-assignment submission, since I spent quite a bit of time on the backend, schema, and report. So that's fun.

As we discuss our app's program flow, the complexity of the app and schema also seems to grow incredibly quickly. On Saturday after the workshop, we came up with this simple 4-table schema that seemed to fit our uses pretty well. And now we're up to seven (last I checked) tables, with more on the way if we decide to implement more complex broadcasting and privacy logic. Fun stuff.

Oh well, back to work.
