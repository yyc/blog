I'm sorry if the title is supposed to be "What you hope to learn in CS3216" because that made no sense to me.

# Hello World!

This blog is set up with Jekyll-Bootstrap, with GitHub Pages, so I get this pretty cool domain for free! Yay!

Moving on..

# What I hope to learn in CS3216

## Preamble
I've been doing programming for a long time (since sec 1). I've slogged through the National Infocomm Competition circuit and its various competitions quite a few times, and won far too few of them for my liking. Still, through these competitions, I have picked up a proficiency in web programming and webapp design in general, specifically in Javascript and PHP (it was cool then, okay?).

I'm only a Y2 student, which means I've only gone through the usual CS1101S+CS2020,CS2100,CS2107 courses, but all of these felt a little easy for me. Over the summer, I did CVWO, which was admittedly quite challenging so that's fun. And there's where I picked up Ruby on Rails and am now reasonably proficient with RoR. That would make me a decent full-stack developer, I think. That brings me to \#1:

## We need to go deeper

I'd love to delve deeper into Web Development. While I've done web dev for a long time, most of it is composed of terrible code and mostly hacked together for a two-week project or competition and discarded.

So I'd like to learn more about web technologies like Rails, Javascript, etc. and hopefully get better at them in time for the final project.

## Life (and your product) is more than just code

At the same time, I'd also like to learn more about the rest of what goes into developing an app, beyond the, y'know, developing part of it. The marketing, design, maintenance, and other soft things that go into making your app a success.
