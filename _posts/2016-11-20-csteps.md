It's STePS day! A part of me is sad that it's almost over, but the other part is thinking PLEASE PLEASE LET IT BE OVER.

It's been a long semester, and everything culminates in this last day. Unfortunately, more than just CS3216 culminates today, because it's also the day of our CS2103 demo. Baaah.
Thankfully, got that over in the morning.

Then I finished up on our STePS Poster, which looks rad, thank you very much.

The right side will hold an iPad (obviously not printed), which shows the total amount of time that users have spent focusing using our app. An attempt to make our STePS booth more interactive and also let visitors know that lots of people are using our app, heh.
