So yeah, our marketing campaign will focus (ha ha) mainly on stickers and posters to try and get the word out to people studying in common areas around the school.

Stickers were designed, once again, by yours truly. We have two main designs, one for individual studying locations (think the cubicles in COM1 and ERC), like below:

We also made another one for group study locations (think the tables ourside ERC starbucks, and outside SR1 in COM1).

Fun stuff. I got it printed over the weekend at Sunshine Plaza, at this shop called Ben's quick print. It was indeed pretty quick, a sheet of 90 stickers took just a couple of hours to print, at approximately $2.50 a sheet. Uncut, of course, which means we had to cut it ourselves. That wasn't too difficult, thankfully, in part because I managed to borrow two paper trimmers from the USP Admin office, and Derek and Chi Thanh made short work of the stack in one afternoon. So now we have stickers! And on Monday after the final CS3126 lesson, we went around school pasting them everywhere we could. Hooray vandalism! (We'll take it down after alright).

Speaking of the final lesson of CS3216, I found out that Prof. Colin shares my LOVE of Cloud Atlas. It's the most amazing book and movie that I've ever watched and I just love the message of the book. Prof. Colin's quote just reminded me of how awesome it all was and how inspiring the message is:

> The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words and deeds, that go on and are pushing themselves throughout all time.

And another, my own personal favorite:

> Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.”

SO AWESOME. Do yourself a favor and (after the semester) go read the book and watch the movie.
